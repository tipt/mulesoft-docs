= Adding Terms and Conditions
:keywords: terms, conditions

Organization and API owners may want to define Terms and Conditions (T&C) that need to be accepted by application developers using API portals. Portal T&Cs can be defined for two different purposes:

. T&Cs that must be accepted before any access to the developer portal - These T&Cs are known as *Portal Terms and Conditions*.
. T&Cs that must be accepted before application registration for an API through it’s API portal - These T&Cs are known as *Request API Access Terms and Conditions*.

Regardless of the the type of T&C, the T&C content can be defined in link:https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/[Markdown] format.

Once you have saved a set of terms of conditions, these will be automatically applied to all the APIs in your organization, no further steps are required.

[NOTE]
Once they do, the current text of the terms and conditions will be recorded on the user's profile. This ensures that, in case these terms and conditions change, the user's contract remains as what he agreed to.

The sections below describe each type of T&C and their behaviour in more details.

== Portal Terms and Conditions

Portal terms and conditions are configured at the API administration page and are globally set for access to the API developer portals for your entire organization.

When set, a T&C acceptance screen will be displayed to users upon their first access to the organization developer portal page, and thereupon, presented again every time the T&C content is changed.

== Request API Access Terms and Conditions

Request API Access T&Cs are presented to users upon registration of an application for an API through the API’s developer portal.

Request API Access T&Cs can be configured in two ways: They can be set at a global level through the API admin page as illustrated below, in which case they will apply to all APIs within the organization.

API owners, can also set at an API version specific Request API Access T&Cs, using the API version details page as shown below. These T&Cs override the global Request API Access T&Cs when defined.

== Organizations with Multiple Business Groups

If you apply these settings at the Master Organization level, these terms and conditions will be used in the APIs of every one of your business groups. If you apply this within the API Administration page of an individual business group, the terms and conditions you set up will override the ones defined at a higher level and affect only the APIs of that business group.

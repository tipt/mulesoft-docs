== What's New

This release incorporates major improvements around Studio’s support for the API development lifecycle, incorporating more seamless integration between Studio and API Designer, expanding support for APIkit, and supporting a unified runtime for API Gateways and Mule. These capabilities include:

* Seamlessly navigate between API designer and Studio by synchronizing (pull, push, compare) your APIs
* Ability to register your APIs in API Manager from within Studio
* The ability to select an API from API Manager to implement from within Studio
* Support for SOAP APIs in APIkit
* An enhanced New Project wizard which supports both REST and SOAP API implementation
* Browse for WSDLs and RAMLs in Exchange to consume APIs in HTTP and WS Consumer
* An early access version of RAML 1.0 to create / edit API definitions and implement flows using APIkit

In addition to these API-related functionalities, Studio also includes many other improvements:
* More detailed data for debugging some connectors, such as HTTP and Database
* Improved error messages, which allow you to clearly see where the error is coming from and click to navigate to that point in the flow
* DataWeave now includes supports for new file formats, allowing you to read and write fixed-width and other flat files using DataWeave. The structure of these files can be easily defined via a new Flat File Definition file format. You can also import COBOL Copybook files into this schema format using Studio (Early Access). Finally, if you have previous DataMapper transformations, you can use the migration tool to convert them to DataWeave transformations now.
* MUnit run multiple suites
* MUnit allows nested folders for tests
* Create MUnit coverage reports from inside Studio
* Autocompletion support for MUnit’s MEL functions
* Metadata support to MUnit message processors
* SAP R/3 Business Suite Connector v3.0.0:
** Support of MEL expressions to define JCo Client Extended Properties.
** Enhancement of DataSense to display additional information. For Functions and BAPIs, it is now possible to identify tables and structures, optional and required fields, the 'real' data type  associated with them (such as Char, Number), their length and a description. For IDocs, segments are also clearly labeled.

This release also features support for all the new capabilities in Mule 3.8, which are found in the Mule 3.8 release notes.

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

* For most use cases, Anypoint Studio with the 3.8 Runtime does not change hardware or software requirements.
* MuleSoft recommends a minimum of 4GB RAM on a developer workstation. As applications become complex, consider adding more RAM.
* This version of Anypoint Studio requires Java 7 or Java 8.

[NOTE]
--
If you are installing Anypoint Studio on a Mac computer with OS X that has no Java installed, the OS may require that you first download and install link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html[JDK 1.6]. Install JDK 1.6 first and then install JDK 1.7.

[NOTE]
--
If you are running McAfee VirusScan on your Windows OS, Eclipse-based Anypoint Studio may experience negative performance impacts. McAfee has suggested the following remedy link:https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB58727[options].

== Migration Guide

From the previous versions of Studio 5.1.0, 5.1.1, 5.2.0, 5.2.1, 5.3.0, 5.4.1, 5.4.2 and 5.4.3, there is no special migration needed, but when opening a previous Workspace with projects that were created with Studio 5.1.0 or older, and which has metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the New Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project.


[TIP]
====
You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.

Then specify the location of your old version of Anypoint Studio in your local drive.

== Known Issues

* API Designer and Studio’s new API sync feature sometimes do not work properly when the RAML file is too long (e.g. 4,000+ lines)
* OData APIKit extension beta does not support RAML 1.0 and the new APIKit integrated within Studio 6.0. For customers using OData extension, please stay with Studio 5.4. We will be releasing an update soon with support for OData.
* DataSense currently does not support RAML 1.0 types.
* Suggester for RAML 1.0 does not support RAML types and RAML files without header.
* MUnit RAML-to-Test autogeneration feature does not support RAML 1.0. We are actively working to evolve the feature.
* Cloudhub and Exchange are not available when using TLS 1.1 or 1.2 under OSX Yosemite.
* Embedded API Console has the following known issues:
* When running an MUnit test over Windows without admin right,  you may find a "could not load library jansi" error. This is due to jar file that log4j uses that tries to use this dll library and if it can not find it then it tries to create it under java.io.tmpdir system property. If the user do not have write permissions to that directory which Windows always returns as `C:\Windows` it will fail.
+
The workaround is to overwrite that property in the lunch configuration: `Djava.io.tmpdir=D:\Users\myUserName` or run Studio as an Administrator
* Studio 6.0 does not support the following Mule 3.8 features:
** RecordVars and record payload should be editable in a commit block.
** Object Store support gaps around Idempotent Redelivery Policy, Aggregators and DevKit token manage

== Jira Ticket List for Anypoint Studio

=== New Features

==== Unified! Single Runtime, APIKit Bundled within Studio and Updated New Project Wizard

Previously, building an API within Studio required installation of API Gateway runtime. Now, Mule 3.8 has become an unified single runtime for both integration and APIs.  Previously, APIKit was updated as a separate plugin. Now, it has become a default component bundled into Studio. We also have integrated SOAP Kit into APIKit. As a result of these unification efforts, we now have an updated New Project Wizard, that simplifies user experience, bridges API Designer and Studio, and reduces complexity by decreasing number of runtime and plugin versions.

==== Seamless API Design-to-Implementation Experience

Now you can seamlessly pull, push and compare between Studio and API Designer with API Sync View.

image::anypoint-studio-6.0-with-3.8-runtime-release-notes-5aa45.png[]

==== Support to Flat Files in DataWeave

DataWeave now supports flat files, allowing to parse files that have hierarchical structures in a text delimited or fixed length form.

image::anypoint-studio-6.0-with-3.8-runtime-release-notes-a88e9.png[]

==== Improved Debugging and Error Messages

The debugger now shows more detailed data for some connectors, such as HTTP and Database, making it easier to debug. The Mule 3.8 runtime also includes improved error messages, which allow you to clearly see where the error is coming from and click to navigate to that point in the flow.

image::anypoint-studio-6.0-with-3.8-runtime-release-notes-357c0.png[]

And a lot more:
* Support for RAML 1.0
* Support for reading and writing fixed width and other flat files using DataWeave (copybook support still Beta, reference doc).
* Support to browse for WSDLs in the exchange when configuring the Web Services Consumer.

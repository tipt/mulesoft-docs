[TIP]
====
DataWeave is a new feature of the 3.7 runtime that replaces the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/datamapper-user-guide-and-reference[DataMapper], which is a major component in previous versions. It's recommended than when possible you use DataWeave to avoid future obsolescence.
====

The link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/dataweave-language-introduction[DataWeave Language] is a simple, powerful tool to query and transform data inside of Mule. It can be used in two different ways:

* you can graphically map fields by dragging and dropping them, as could be done with the deprecated link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/datamapper-transformer-reference[DataMapper]
* or you can leverage its powerful JSON-like language that's purposely built to make writing transformations as fast as possible and highly maintainable over the long term.
It supports a variety of transformations, from simple one-to-one mappings, to more elaborate mappings including normalization, grouping, joins, partitioning, pivoting and filtering.

You can also call upon the power of DataWeave language in other components through link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/mel-dataweave-functions[Mule Expression Language DataWeave Functions].

The language is tightly integrated with Mule ESB and Anypoint Studio. Use the *Transform Message* component, that allows you to use the language to query and transform data through DataWeave. Any mappings you perform through the graphical interface will be expressed in DataWeave code in real time and vice versa. It fully supports DataSense, allowing you to leverage metadata from connectors, schemas and sample documents to more easily design your transformations. DataSense provides content assist while you are coding and scaffolds your mappings to help make writing transformations fast and easy.

[TIP]
====
If you have projects that are built with the deprecated link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/datamapper-user-guide-and-reference[DataMapper], a migration tool is now included in Studio, which assists in converting a DataMapper map to DataWeave: Right click on a DataMapper, select *Migrate to DataWeave*, and follow the instructions.

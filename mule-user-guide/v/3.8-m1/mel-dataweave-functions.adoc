= MEL DataWeave functions
:keywords: mel, cheat, sheet

The link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/mule-expression-language-mel[Mule Expression Language (MEL)] includes two functions that take advantage of the powerful link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/dataweave[DataWeave] transformation language, ideal for carrying out complex data transformations.

All components in Mule that support Mule Expression Language also support expressions written in DataWeave Language.

[TIP]
The DataWeave language is easiest to use by adding a *Transform Message Component* to your flow, as it offers a graphical UI to build automatic mappings through a drag-and-drop interface, as well as rich debugging features. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/using-dataweave-in-studio[Using DataWeave in Studio] for more details.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes you are familiar with both link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/mule-expression-language-reference[Mule Expression Language] and link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/dataweave-language-introduction[DataWeave Language].

== The DW Function

To invoke an expression written in DataWeave language, simply invoke the `dw()` function, the expression will return whatever the transform outputs.

DataWeave expressions defined within this function work just as those defined within a Transform Message element, the only difference is that the output is returned into the expression's result, wherever it may be.

[NOTE]
The DataWeave expression that you write in this function must be enclosed in "quotation marks"

For example, you can define a custom object and populate it with elements from the payload:

[source,code]
----
dw("myobject:{id:payload.accountid, user:payload.user}")
----

That same expression could be added inside a Logger, within a MEL expression, to print out its result:

[source,code]
----
#[dw("myobject:{id:payload.accountid, user:payload.user}")]
----


The function has the following attributes:

[cols="30a,70a",options="header"]
|===
|Attributes |Description
|DataWeave Expression |The actual DataWeave expression to carry out
|Output Type	| The type of the output of the transform
|Reader Properties	| For inputs such as CSV, sometimes some properties are needed to know how to parse the input, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/using-dataweave-in-studio#reader-configuration[Reader Configuration]
|Writer Properties	| For inputs such as CSV, sometimes some properties are needed to compose the output, see ink:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/dataweave-language-introduction#output-directive[Output Directive]

|===





== The Split Function

The `split()` function runs an expression written in DataWeave language and returns an iterator who's result can be then processed by your flow one index at a time. It takes at least two arguments: a DataWeave expression and the desired output type. This function may be equivalent to running the 'dw()' function and then adding an additional step to your flow, such as a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/foreach[Foreach Scope], but it's less heavy on resources.

[NOTE]
The DataWeave expression that you write in this function must be enclosed in "quotation marks". It must also return a single array.

Below is the most basic DW expression you can write, but you could also put any other DW expression as long as it returns an iterable list.

[source,code]
----
split('payload','application/json')
----

That same expression could be added inside a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/foreach[Foreach Scope] in the *Collection* field, to use this expression to parse the payload into a separate set of messages to process individually:

[source,code]
----
<flow name="myFlow">
    <foreach collection="split('payload','application/json')" doc:name="For Each">
        <logger message="[#payload]" level="INFO" doc:name="Logger"/>
    </foreach>
</flow>
----




The function has the following attributes:

[cols="30a,70a",options="header"]
|===
|Attributes |Description
|DataWeave Expression |The actual DataWeave expression to carry out
|Output Type	| The type of the output of the transform
|Reader Properties	| For inputs such as CSV, sometimes some properties are needed to know how to parse the input, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/using-dataweave-in-studio#reader-configuration[Reader Configuration]
|Writer Properties	| For inputs such as CSV, sometimes some properties are needed to compose the output, see ink:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/dataweave-language-introduction#output-directive[Output Directive]

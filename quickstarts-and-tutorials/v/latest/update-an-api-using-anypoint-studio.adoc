= Update an API Using Anypoint Studio

This section covers how to update your legacy SOAP application and integrate it to the T-Shirt API you created earlier in Anypoint Platform.

== Consume a Web Service

This section covers how to integrate the RAML API to consume the original SOAP-based service. The operations in WSDL of the legacy service align with the RAML resources of your API in the Studio project.

To consume a web service:

. On the first flow, click the HTTP Connector, which opens the properties editor for the Connector below the canvas.
. Next to the *Connector Configuration* field, click image:Edit-16x16.gif[Edit-16x16] to set the properties for the global connector element.
. Change the port value from the default 8081 to `${http.port}` and the _All Interfaces [0.0.0.0] (Default)_ host to `${http.host}`.
+
This expression makes the port value equal to the values of `http.port` and `http.host` properties in the `mule-app.properties` file at runtime. +
This is a regular good practice to keep consistency along your application configuration. Using properties instead of raw values saves you the work of remembering in which global configuration you configured certain values, and as your applications grow more complex, setting your configuration values in one _properties_ file allows you to replicate the updated value to al relevant global configurations.
+
. In the package explorer, double-click `mule-app.properties` in the `src/main/app` folder.
+
The `mule-app.properties` file opens.
. Add the following line, and then save the change:
+
`http.port=8081` +
`http.host=0.0.0.0`
+
. In the *get:/products:api-config* flow, delete *Set Payload*. Select the *Set Payload* element, and click *Delete* on the context menu.
. Drag the *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/web-service-consumer[Web Service Consumer]* connector from the palette to the empty *Process* section of the flow.
. Click the Web Service Consumer. In the properties editor, click image:plus-1.png[plus-1].
+
The link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.6/global-elements[Global Element] Properties dialog for the Web Service Consumer appears.
+
. In *WSDL Location*, type: http://tshirt-service.cloudhub.io/?wsdl
+
Studio infers the values for Service, Port, and Address fields from the WSDL and populates the fields.
+
image:GE.png[GE]
+
Click OK.
+
. In the properties editor of the Web Service Consumer, select the *ListInventory* operation from the drop-down in *Operation*.
+
image:WSC+configured.png[WSC+configured]
+
Studio populates the Operation drop-down by inference from the WSDL.
+
. Repeat steps 6 - 7 for the *get:/orders/status:t-shirt-config* and *post:/orders:t-shirt-config* flows.
. Repeat step 10 for these flows, but instead of ListInventory, select TrackOrder (item 3 on the drop-down) and OrderTShirt (item 2 on the drop-down), for the respective flows.
+
Your flows now call the Web service, generating requests using the XML message structures required by this Web service.

== Transform Incoming and Outgoing Messages

Messages to and from the Web Service Consumer are not in the required JSON format. In this section you map the XML messages to the expected formats.


. From the palette, drag the DataWeave transformer, labeled *Transform Message*, to the get and post resources flows. Include five instances of Transform Message in your project:
+
* One to the right of the Web Service Consumer in the *get:/products:api-config* flow
* Two, one to the right and one to the left of the Web Service Consumer in the *get:/orders/status:t-shirt-config* flow
* Two, one to the right and one to the left of the Web Service Consumer in the  *post:/orders:t-shirt-config*
+
image:other+flows+w+dw.png[other+flows+w+dw]
+
. Click Transform Message on the `get:/products:t-shirt-config` flow.
+
The Transform Message properties appear. In the left pane, Input, contains a representation of the XML message from the WSDL. The middle pane, Output, contains a JSON representation of the message.
. Construct your Dataweave expressions in the *Output Payload* pane to transform the XML to JSON to match the examples in your RAML. Use Dataweave keywords and autocomplete as follows:
+
image:input+example.png[input+example]
+
Use the following Dataweave expressions for the respective flows:
+
*get:/products:api-config*
+
[source,dataweave,linenums]

%output application/json
---
 [{
    "productCode": payload.ListInventoryResponse.*inventory.productCode,

. Save your project.

== Next

Now that your application can interact with your SOAP legacy project, let's apply one more change to your RAML file and link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/sync-your-api-with-anypoint-platform.[synchronize your updated project with Anypoint Platform using API Sync].

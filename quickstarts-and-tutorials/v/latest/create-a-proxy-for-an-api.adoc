= Create a Proxy for an API
:keywords: api, notebook, client

Anypoint Platform and Anypoint Studio support connecting to the internet through a proxy. Generally, traffic outside an organization is routed through a proxy to its destination.

You need to use a proxy when your endpoint does not reside on Anypoint Platform, but on another host, so Anypoint Platform can track the endpoint. Creating a proxy for the inbound endpoint of an API is required for the following operations:

* Synchronizing a project in Anypoint Studio with an API in Anypoint Platform.
* Governing an API with SLAs
* Setting up and enforcing link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/applying-runtime-policies[runtime policies]

In this example, the proxy is required to synchronize your work on Studio and Anypoint Platform.

== Prerequisites for Creating a Proxy for an API

To create a proxy for an API on Anypoint Platform, you first need to set up the following things:

* An API on Anypoint Platform
+
Set up the T-Shirt Order Service API for this example if you have not already done so.
* API Version Owner role for the API
+
By virtue of setting up the T-Shirt Order Service API, you are the API Version Owner.

== Create an Endpoint Proxy

To create a proxy for the inbound endpoint of an API:

. link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Sign in to the Anypoint Platform for APIs] and click *APIs*:
. Click the version number of an API, the 1.0development version of the T-Shirt Ordering Service for example.
+

+
. Under *API Status*, click *Configure Endpoint*.
+

+
The Configure Endpoint menu opens:
+
image:api-gateway-config-endpt-menu.png[api-gateway-config-endpt-menu, width="500"]
+
. Expand the drop-down *Type* to select the type of endpoint:
+
* RAML
* HTTP URL
* WSDL
+
. For this example, select *HTTP URL*.
+
. Click *Save*.

== Applying Policies

Having set up a proxy, you can now apply or remove one or more policies, or a set of organizational-level policies, to govern your API version at runtime. As an Organization Owner, you can set the order in which API Manager enforces policies and whether a policy is optional or required. For more information, see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/applying-runtime-policies[Applying Runtime Policies].

= Import an API Into Anypoint Studio

Using Anypoint Studio, you can enhance, change, mock, and link:\[test an API] that you create in Anypoint Platform. In Studio, you can also create a new API or a new version of an API based on a existing API in Anypoint Platform. After making changes to an API in Anypoint Studio, you can synchronize your work in Studio and Anypoint Platform.

== Prerequisites

To create a Studio project for the example T-Shirt API on Anypoint Platform, you first need to set up the following things:

* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/create-an-api[An API in Anypoint Platform]
* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/create-a-proxy-for-an-api[A proxy] for the inbound endpoint of the API

This tutorial showcases the basic usage of Studio for working with an API deployed in Anypoint Platform. +
If this is your first time using Studio, we also recommend you to take a look at our link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8-m1/basic-studio-tutorial[Basic Studio Tutorial] for a more detailed explanation of each tool and view within Studio.

== Create a Project Based on a RAML

To create a Mule project in Studio based on an existing RAML API:

. Click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project* to create a project, and set the field values in the new project wizard:
+
* Type an arbitrary name for the project, for example `t-shirt`.
* Select a Mule Server, for example Mule Server 3.8.0 EE.
* Check *Add APIkit components*.
* In API Definition, click the browse ... button, and select *Anypoint Platform*.
+

+
The Browse API Manager for APIs dialog appears.
+
. Click *Add Credentials*.
+
The *Anypoint Platform Sign In* dialog appears.
+

+
. Enter your user name and password, and click *Sign In*.
+
The names and versions of your APIs in your Anypoint Platform organization, for example the *Enterprises* organization appear. If you belong to multiple organizations, use the drop-down located above the list of APIs to select your APIs in other organizations.
+

+
. Select the API you want to use in Studio, *T-Shirt Ordering Service* in this example. Click *OK*. Click *Finish*.
+
The `t-shirt.xml` file appears in the `src/main/app` folder of the Package Explorer. The `api-main` flow appears at the top of the canvas and contains the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/apikit-basic-anatomy[APIkit Router]. Below the main flow, are the other flows defined by the RAML--one for each resource/method pairing defined within the RAML spec. Do not rename these flows.

Take a moment to see all the default views that are loaded once the SOAP application is imported.

If you are familiar with link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8-m1/anypoint-studio-essentials#the-visual-editor[Anypoint Studio's visual editor], you notice a new view loaded next to the Mule Palette.

This is the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/api-sync-reference[API Sync] view, which allows you to synchronize your changes with Anypoint Platform and to download all updates from the Anypoint Platform to your Studio instance. This feature is covered link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/sync-your-api-with-anypoint-platform[later in this tutorial].
--
+
The project creation process also adds a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/reference-exception-strategy[Reference Exception Strategy] to handle all possible errors.
+
. Select *Run project t-shirt* from the context menu.
+
The Console below the canvas shows the output of building and deploying the project. The APIkit Consoles tab contains a mockup of the API operations identical to the mockup you used earlier in the API Designer.

Use the mocking service and enter the email address and an orderId as a query parameter to retrieve a particular order. +

In response, you receive a status 200: success!

[NOTE]
--
The regular expression used to define the pattern of each query parameter might cause the APIKit to flag those fields as _Invalid pattern_. +
If this happens, click on *Force GET* to see the results.
